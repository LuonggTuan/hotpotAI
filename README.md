# Essential Algorithms for AI

This repository collects and explains core algorithms that serve as the backbone of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  
The goal is to provide simple, clear, and well-documented implementations that help learners, researchers, and developers understand *how AI works under the hood*.

## ðŸ“Œ What's Inside?

This repo covers algorithms that appear frequently across AI, machine learning, deep learning and data science.  
Each algorithm comes with:
- **Readable code** (Python-first, extendable later)  
- **Step-by-step explanations** in comments or markdown  
- **Examples** to show practical usage  

*(This list will grow over time.)*
